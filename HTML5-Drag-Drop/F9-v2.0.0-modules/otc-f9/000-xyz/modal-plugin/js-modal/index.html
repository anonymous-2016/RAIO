                Getting Started The difference between building a plugin and a project component lies in flexibility. <br/> The first thing we are going to is take a step back and think about the requirements. <br/> Our modal plugin should: Launch different
                modals based upon option sets Allow users to define custom transitions Be responsive Have max/min width points Anchor to the top of the page if too tall Be centered otherwise Accept a HTML string for content OR a domNode Have no dependencies
                See that last line? <br/> Thats right folks, we're doing this in plain old Javascript. <br/>The Javascript Architecture Alright, lets get our hands dirty. <br/>Our first order of business is going to be deciding on our plugin architecture
                and picking a design pattern. <br/>Let's create an IIFE to create a closure we can work within. <br/> Closures can be leveraged to create a private scope, where you have control over what data you make available.</p>
