                    <p>Getting Started The difference between building a plugin and a project component lies in flexibility. <br> The first thing we are going to is take a step back and think about the requirements. <br> Our modal plugin should: Launch different
                        modals based upon option sets Allow users to define custom transitions Be responsive Have max/min width points Anchor to the top of the page if too tall Be centered otherwise Accept a HTML string for content OR a domNode Have no
                        dependencies See that last line? <br> Thats right folks, we're doing this in plain old Javascript. <br>The Javascript Architecture Alright, lets get our hands dirty. <br>Our first order of business is going to be deciding on our
                        plugin architecture and picking a design pattern. <br>Let's create an IIFE to create a closure we can work within. <br> Closures can be leveraged to create a private scope, where you have control over what data you make available.
